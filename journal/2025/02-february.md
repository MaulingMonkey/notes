I once again muse over the creation of a "layer 2"(?) WASI OS, and find myself [searching lib.rs for IPC crates](https://lib.rs/search?q=ipc).
The [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) describes 7 networking layers &mdash;
Physical, Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application &mdash;
which are then awkwardly used to describe e.g. Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP, SOAP, and whatever application specific JSON horrors might be embedded within.

I feel there might be room for a similar description of *Operating System* layers.
Describing things which are OS-*adjacent*, we have:
*   Motherboard firmware (modern UEFI-supporting BIOSes are bootloaders themselves, and run complicated GUI apps for hardware management, flashing firmware, etc.)
*   Bootloaders (micro OSes which exist only to allow the selection and running of "real" OSes?)
*   Hypervisors (micro OSes which exist mainly to manage the running of "real" OSes?)
*   "Operating Systems" (the meat and potatos that most people talk about such as Windows, Linux, etc.)
*   Device firmware (a modern hard drive might have an ARM core running Linux just to talk to the motherboard!)
*   Emacs! (while people joke, other user space software such as browsers *absolutely* roll their own hardware I/O for gamepads etc. which make the claim to "being an operating system" much less satirical - to say nothing of Chrome OS.)

In the world of lightweight VMs:

*   <https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight>

Alternatively, instead of numbering layers, other options include terms like:
*   "Platform" [as suggested by Discord](https://discord.com/channels/186813135263367169/1089980828848762921/1336157501120450580) to encompass Chrome, Emacs, etc. without the narrower impliciation of "Operating System".
*   Sub-OS
*   ~~Child Operating System~~
*   ~~Child System~~
