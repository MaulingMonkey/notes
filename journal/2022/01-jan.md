## Friday January 7th, 2022
*   Merged (private) thin3d9 into public [thindx](https://github.com/MaulingMonkey/thindx), pushed <https://docs.rs/thindx/> w/ screenshots
*   Worked on (private) 12-bit fantasy console ISA/emulator (match statements vs fn ptr arrays is interesting to compare codegen for)
*   CI cleanup of [jni-bindgen](https://github.com/MaulingMonkey/jni-bindgen)
*   Discovered [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) \([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29837696), [Article](https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/)\),
    which looks close to the ideal sync framework I'd been considering "inventing"

### TODO:
*   Experiment with Syncthing for code backup, media sync?
*   Fuzz coverage for thindx
*   Finish `thindx::d3d9::*`
*   Example coverage for `thindx::d3d9::*`
