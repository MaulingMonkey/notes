Caffeine rationing begins.  Boo.  Hiss.

## Densities

| What              | kg/m3             | Source    |
| ------------------| ------------------| ----------|
|        Air        | ≈    1.2 -  1.275 | <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth>   <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=air>
| Liquid air        | ≈  870 -  875.4   |   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_air>          <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=liquid+air>
| Liquid nitrogen   | ≈  810.6          | ~~<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen>~~   <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=liquid+nitrogen>
| Liquid oxygen     | ≈ 1141 - 1146     |   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen>       <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=liquid+oxygen>

## Storage / Generation from Solids

> Oxygen tanks containing pressures of up to 200 bar (3000 psi) are used for industrial processes including the manufacturing of steel and monel, welding and cutting, medical breathing gas, diving and as an emergency breathing gas in aircraft. A small steel tank of 16 litres water capacity with a working pressure of 139 bar (2015 psi), holds about 2150 litres of gas and weighs 28 kilograms (62 lb).[3] 2150 litres of oxygen, without the steel tank, weighs about 3 kilograms (6.6 lb)

> The Vika oxygen generating system, used on Mir and later the International Space Station under the NASA designation Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator (SFOG) is based on lithium perchlorate, which releases about 60% of its weight in oxygen. Of all the perchlorates, lithium perchlorate has both the highest oxygen to weight and oxygen to volume ratio, except beryllium diperchlorate which is expensive and toxic. The Vika system uses a canister containing about 1 liter (2.4 kg) of perchlorate to generate 600 liters (0.86 kg) of oxygen, enough for one person for one day.

TL;DR: Replenishing an oxygen atmosphere from ≈200x denser "warm" storage is possible.
Cold storage could bump that higher (700x?), and would be an "easy" means of reversable storage that wouldn't undergo explosive decompression if storage vessels are weakened during combat...?

## Preparing for Space Combat

*   Depressurize?  Partially?
*   Perhaps cool and liquify oxygen, but keep nitrogen, for leak detection / quenching fires?
*   Can't use CO2 as the inert gas post-combat, so storing some source of nitrogen for restoring lost atmosphere after battle damage would be reasonable:
    > Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen,
    > manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour.
