-   Sushi belts for supplying malls?  Even post-bots I hate walking around for mass whatever.
-   Instead of setting up ammo belts, can I just spam full yellow ammo turrets?
    -   Will military research let me handle medium biters?
    -   Large biters might not show up until I have laser turrets?
    -   Laser turrets might not pack enough dakka for large biter spam?
        -   No, they should, it's just a question of Rate of Fire, right?
        -   ...Flamethrower turrets if they don't?

Power is restored after a ≈2d4h outage.
I'd say I got the short end of the stick again, but there are still downed traffic lights and lines... some of my neighbors have it worse for once.
This has motivated another shopping list..

-   [x] An ash bucket, so I don't choke to death on carbon monoxide emitted by unnoticed embers.
-   [x] Something for log splitting.  Dedicated splitting maul?  Splitting wedge?  Can't get the mid-sized sticks needed for kindling from stores reliably.
-   [ ] Battery backup?  LiFePO4?
