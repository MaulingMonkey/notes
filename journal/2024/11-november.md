## Factorio
-   Sushi belts for supplying malls?  Even post-bots I hate walking around for mass whatever.
-   Instead of setting up ammo belts, can I just spam full yellow ammo turrets?
    -   Will military research let me handle medium biters?
    -   Large biters might not show up until I have laser turrets?
    -   Laser turrets might not pack enough dakka for large biter spam?
        -   No, they should, it's just a question of Rate of Fire, right?
        -   ...Flamethrower turrets if they don't?
