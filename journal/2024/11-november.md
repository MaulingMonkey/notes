-   Sushi belts for supplying malls?  Even post-bots I hate walking around for mass whatever.
-   Instead of setting up ammo belts, can I just spam full yellow ammo turrets?

    -   Large biters might not show up until I have laser turrets?
    -   Laser turrets might not pack enough dakka for large biter spam?
