## Atmospheric Pressure

| atm   | Description   |
| ------| --------------|
| 1.000 | sea level
| 0.333 | Mt. Everest Peak.  Some climb that high without supplimental oxygen... if they're quite fit and acclimitazed.  95% don't.  It's really pushing the limit.
| 0.12  | Wikipedia suggests a pressure suit is required to safely operate an aircraft at this point ([15km ≈ 0.12 atm](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=atmospheric+pressure+at+15km+elevation+in+atm).)
| 0.062 | [Armstrong limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit).  You'll die within minutes as body fluids start boiling away, no matter how much oxygen you're getting.

> At or above the Armstrong limit, exposed body fluids such as saliva, tears, urine, and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungs—but not vascular blood (blood within the circulatory system)—will boil away if the subject does not wear a full-body pressure suit, and no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes.
