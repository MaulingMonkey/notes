## DOS Memory Models

Generally assumes 8086 Real Mode, where `physical = segment << 4 + offset` (allowing ≈1 MiB of memory access via ≈20 bits.)

| Pointer Type  | Description   |
| --------------| --------------|
| Near          | 16-bit offset, segment implicit
| Far           | 32-bit segment:offset
| Huge          | 32-bit segment:offset, plus recalculation for >16-bit offsets

| Memory Model  | Data Ptr  | Fn Ptr    | Notes |
| --------------| ----------| ----------| ------|
| Tiny          | Near      | Near      | All segment registers equal
| Small         | Near      | Near      | Seperate code and data segments
| Medium        | Far       | Near      | "particularly useful for games"
| Compact       | Near      | Far       | Unusual.
| Large         | Far       | Far       | 64 KB limit to all offsets
| Huge          | Huge      | Huge?     | 32-bit offsets by recalculation



## COM programs
-   CS=DS=SS (Code Segment = Data Segment = Stack Segment).  ES (Extra Segment) might also be set.  This is effectively the "Tiny" DOS memory model.
-   Exactly which segment is specified is nonspecific.
-   That leaves you with ≈64 KiB of code and data.
-   Execution starts with `jmp cs:100h`

Memory layout within that segment:

| Start | End   | Description       |
| ------| ------| ------------------|
| 0000h | 00FFh | **[Program Segment Prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Segment_Prefix)**
| 0100h | SP-1  | **Code and Data (as blitted from COM file)**
| SP    | FFFFh | **Stack**
