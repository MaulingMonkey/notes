# Visual Studio Code

My preferred IDE for Rust development.  Decent intellisense.

# Visual Studio

Second rate support, but I occasionally resort to this for it's profiler or Direct3D graphics debugger.

*   Abandoned ancient slow/chuggy incomplete VisualRust plugin provides syntax highlighting, intellisense, Rust "projects".

# IntelliJ

Too much opaque per-project boilerplate for my tastes.
That said, they have their own well crafted intellisense engine that was in a good state before anything else.
As such, it's probably what you want if you're not a weirdo like me?
