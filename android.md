# Workarounds and Android/Samsung/??? Bugs

## App can't be reinstalled after uninstall

Uninstalling through the tablet apps list UI on my `SM-T510` leaves android packages in a partially uninstalled state
where the command line tools can't reinstall to the same package name afterwards, despite supposedly "succeeding" (they
won't show up in the app list nor in `adb shell pm list packages`).  To work around this bug, you can use adb to fully
uninstall with e.g. `adb shell pm uninstall com.maulingmonkey.rust_android_sample`, then reinstall normally.

## I keep ending up with stale builds

Flakey USB connections can cause `adb` to lie and say it successfully installed a package when it didn't.  If you want
to automatically detect this, parse the output of `adb shell pm path com.maulingmonkey.rust_android_sample` before and
after install.  If the path didn't change, it probably didn't redeploy.  You can doublecheck the file size and time
(again before/after install) if you want to eliminate false positives.  If the given path was
`package:/data/app/com.maulingmonkey.rust_android_sample-GmoQAziYbu5PsGZYuXfzUA==/base.apk` , you can then strip the
`package:` prefix and run: `adb shell ls -l /data/app/com.maulingmonkey.rust_android_sample-GmoQAziYbu5PsGZYuXfzUA==/base.apk` .
If that didn't change either, the package almost certainly failed to reinstall.

## My APK is too large (>100MB!)

For the google store, you need to use <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files">APK Expansion Files</a>.
For the amazon store, larger APKs (1GB?) are supported, and APK Expansion Files are not.

## I can't read my `.obb` expansion files

Earlier versions of the Downloader Library failed to request the proper storage permissions at runtime, although
[apkx_sample](https://github.com/google/play-apk-expansion/blob/9ecf54e5ce7c5a74a2eeedcec4d940ea52b16f0e/apkx_sample/src/com/example/google/play/apkx/SampleDownloaderActivity.java#L446-L514)
looks like it might be requesting everything now?  I can't find the old bug report either... the worst part is
that *sometimes* access would work, sometimes not!

## SIGILL

[A big LITTLE Problem: A Tale of big.LITTLE Gone Wrong](https://medium.com/@niaow/a-big-little-problem-a-tale-of-big-little-gone-wrong-e7778ce744bb) - "LITTLE" cores may not have all the instructions of a "big" core, leading to occasional crashes.

## My program crashes so hard the debugger detatches!

`glLinkProgram` can crash so hard the debugger detatches with some invalid shaders on some phones.
I recall a pixel shader involving array parameters - strictly speaking not legal GLES2, but something that worked on many phones - might've caused this in one case.
Resort to printf style debugging to locate the problem.
