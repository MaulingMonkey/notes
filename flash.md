# Development Projects

#### [Iggy](http://www.radgametools.com/iggy.htm) - 💲🐵 Gamedev UI
The alternative gamedev solution for embedding flash into games for UI.

#### [RABCDAsm](https://github.com/CyberShadow/RABCDAsm) - 🐵 Robust ABC (ActionScript Bytecode) [Dis-]Assembler.
Used this and a miserable pile of regular expressions to rewrite flash bytecode & inject parseable logging spam to create a poor man's debugger and profiler at one point.

#### [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) - Flash emulator, targeting destkop/web/browser extension.
Ruffle is an Adobe Flash Player emulator written in the Rust programming language.
"Ruffle targets both the desktop and the web using WebAssembly."
Looks neat!  Supposedly sponsored by newsgrounds.  Comes in a browser extension variation too, so this might allow abandoned websites to continue functioning.

#### [swf2js](https://swf2js.com/en/index.html) - Flash emulator/transpiler?
Japanese devs?  AS3 "production version" might be paid / closed source?

#### [Scaleform](https://www.autodesk.com/products/scaleform/features/all/gallery-view) - 💲 Gamedev UI
The traditional gamedev solution for embedding flash into games for UI.
