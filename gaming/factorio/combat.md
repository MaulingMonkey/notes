## Warptorio 2

I like Warptorio 2's combat loop.

-   Your main platform causes massive aggro.  It must be defended.  It's a relatively small region, so investing in automation, multi-layered defenses, etc. is sensible.
-   While it's quite possible to enter a "death spiral" where resources are spent faster than they are acquired, warping away resets the problem - at the expense of your current mining setup.
    -   This gives you an actual tactical decision: if it's time to bug out or not.
-   Your mining outposts also aggro.  They must be defended.  They're also relatively small.  They come in two flavors:
    -   Mining platforms.  Investing in automation is sensible.
    -   Non-platform.  Hand built.  Typically burner everything, so hand fed turrets are the name of the game.
        Sometimes they get overrun when enemy attacks become too heavy for you to safely tear things down.
        The expansion can also suprise warp you away.



## Vanilla: Nauvis

I dislike Nauvis's combat loop.
Defending a large area (your smelting, your manufacturing malls, science setups, etc.) when you control only one character is fustrating.
Death spirals cannot be easily escaped.
As such, I feel the need to be proactive:
-   Hunt down all nearby biter bases
    -   Time consuming (lots of travel time)
    -   Varies between "easy" and "obnoxiously turret spammy... and even *more* time consuming"
    -   Evolution encourages continuing the hunt the entire duration it's "easy", because it won't be in the future.
-   Secure borders
    -   With *tons* of turrets (chokepoints aren't so bad... but you often lack chokepoints.)
    -   Spam radar + pole + solar triples
    -   Not particularly creative
-   Defend your juicy core?
    -   Usually pointless because you went on the offensive
    -   If you *didn't* go offensive and actually have attackers, 90% of your inner defenses were pointless and outgrown before they were tested.
    -   Biters will somehow find a way to that *one* full chest of *expensive stuff*

One modless fix to this is to crank up the water and play on an islandy or near-islandy map.
That does admittedly feel a bit cheaty.
I could limit myself from destroying biter bases off the "main" island?
Or perhaps give myself a ratio of "nature preserves" vs "paved for industry"?
Perhaps my problem is actually simply that I don't use defender capsules and remote control tanks...
