# Factorio: Pollution
*   Miners are the primary source of pollution IME.
*   Power and furnaces are secondary.
*   Enemy evolution is driven by *global* pollution: it doesn't matter if it was absorbed by biter nests or not, so don't go culling biter nests in an attempt to reduce evolution.  Cull to reduce ammo use to managable levels and save on mining power to generate ammo.
*   Efficiency modules decrease power consumption decrease pollution generation forestall evolution.
    *   Assembler 3s, Electric Mining Drills:   3x `Efficiency 1`s = `-90%` power, capped to `-80%`
    *   Assembler 2s, Electric Furnaces:        2x `Efficiency 2`s = `-80%` power = cap.
*   [Speed modules are sometimes more efficient than Efficiencies](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=59989) (Factorio Forums)
