# Factorio: Oil Ratios

## 20x Refinery Layout (Standard)

Two rows of 10 adjacent refineries comes out to just two tiles taller than two rows of 24 smelters.

Buildings:
*   20 Oil Refineries:  Advanced Oil Processing
*   17 Chemical Plants: Light Oil Cracking
*    5 Chemical Plants: Heavy Oil Cracking

Results:
*   19.5 petroleum / refinery / second (up from 9.0/r/s for basic oil processing)
*   390 petroleum / 20 refineries / second

Uses:
*   19.5 Chemical Plants: Petroleum → Solid Fuel
    *   You should use light oil instead of cracking it for better results
    *   Recipe of last resort to keep heavy/light oil unblocked?
    *   Combine with light oil for rocket fuel?
*   19.5 Chemical Plants: 39 Plastic/s (≈ 3x yellow belts worth / 1x blue belt)
    *   ???: 19.5 Red Circuits/s
    *   ???:  7.8 Low Density Structures/s
*   13.0 Chemical Plants: 26 Sulfur/s  (≈ 2x yellow belts worth / 1x red belt)
    *   104 Chemical Plants: 208 Explosives/s (!!!)
    *  5.2+52 Chemical Plants:  13 Batteries/s (5.2 to create sulfuric acid, 52 to create batteries - consider instead 5+50 or other multiple of 1+10)

## 20x Refinery Layout (Rocket Fuel)

Buildings:
*   20 Oil Refineries:  Advanced Oil Processing
*    0 ~~Chemical Plants: Light Oil Cracking~~
*    5 Chemical Plants: Heavy Oil Cracking
*   11 Chemical Plants: Petroleum → Solid Fuel (enable only if backed up?)
*   22 Chemical Plants: Light Oil → Solid Fuel
*   50 Chemical Plants: Rocket Fuel (49.5)

Fluid Results (Processing + Cracking):
*   220 Petroleum / 20 refineries / second
*   255 Light Oil / 20 refineries / second

Processing (per second):
*   220 Petroleum → 11 Solid Fuel
*   220 Light Oil → 22 Solid Fuel
*    33 Light Oil → 3.3 Rocket Fuel
*     2 Light Oil → Unused
