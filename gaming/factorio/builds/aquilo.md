## Trains

-   Useful for transporting solid fuel for heat, since that spreads so poorly/slowly via heat pipes.
-   Pointless for transporting power.
    Just co-locate power generation directly next to oil.
    Transport power from there with [Big electric pole]s.
    Use an [Accumulator] and [Power switch] if you want to cut off power distribution in the event of a brownout.



### Unload Heat

-   You can easily fit 4 x Heating Towers, each fed by 3 x (Burner inserter → chest → burner inserter), around a single unloading wagon.
