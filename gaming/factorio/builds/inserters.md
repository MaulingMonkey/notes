# Overview

A single row of assemblers feeding neighbors works:

| Assembler     | Plate | Gear  | Green | Other                                                         | Notes |
| --------------| ------| ------| ------| --------------------------------------------------------------| ------|
| Burner        | 1     | 1     |       |                                                               | For boiler use only.
| Long-handed   | 1     | 1     |       | 1x Regular inserter                                           |
| Regular       | 1     | 1     | 1     |                                                               |
| Fast          | 2     |       | 2     | 1x Regular inserter                                           |
| Bulk          |       | 15    | 15    | 1x Fast inserter, 1x Red circuit                              | Gear/circuit hog.
| Stack         |       |       |       | 1x Bulk inserter, 1x Blue circuit, 10x Jelly, 2x Carbon fiber | Gleba only.

Stack inserters require Jelly, which spoils in 4 minutes.
Jelly's source, Jellynuts, last longer - but the seeds should be kept on Gleba.
As such, stack inserters need not be planned for on Nauvis's construction plans.
