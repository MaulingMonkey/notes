## Comparison Table

| Fuel                  | kJ                | Stack | Rocket    | Spoilage          | Notes |

| Solid Fuel            |            12,000 |    50 |   1,000   |                   | 3x density via oil
| Rocket Fuel           |           100,000 |    20 |   † 100   |                   | IIRC, not actually an improvement in total output per input vs Solid Fuel thanks to the ratios?  Also 2/5ths the stack size of solid fuel.  Also can't be insertered into rockets.
| Nuclear Fuel          |         1,210,000 |     1 |      10   |                   | 1/20th the stack size of Nuclear Fuel, so it's less dense per stack!  1x Shiny/Fuel
| Uranium Fuel Cell     |  ‡&nbsp;8,000,000 |    50 |      10   |                   | 0.1 Shiny 1.9 Unshiny per Fuel.  Reactor bonuses stretch things more.
| Tree Seed             |               200 |    10 |     100   |

| Nutrients             |      ‡&nbsp;2,000 |   100 | ~~2,000~~ | 5&nbsp;minutes    | Only usable by biochambers.

| Jelly                 |             1,000 |   100 | ~~2,000~~ | 4&nbsp;minutes    |

## Notes: Gleba

-   Process fruits once to avoid losing seeds, otherwise you can turn everything into nutrients or burn for energy.
-   Heat is not passively lost once stable, so skipping directly to 500&deg;C steam via burner towers is viable.
    -   Use the copious amounts of wood as a starter fuel IMO.  It's everywhere even if you *do* want it for crafting.  And 50 pips gleba science unlocks tree planting for Nauvis.
