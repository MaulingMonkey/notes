| Intermediate  | Columns   | Conclusion    |
| --------------| ---------:| --------------|
| Iron          | 29        | Maybe dedicate a full belt
| Steel         | 25        | A half belt is fine - you don't have the 5x smelting array to saturate a full belt
| Gears         | 23        | Red belts are extremely gear hungry, maybe dedicate a full belt
| Pipe          | 10        |
| Sticks        |  5        |
| Engines       |  4        |
| Copper        |  5 .. 11  | Semi-niche to need *directly*, consider making it a "main" belt of a secondary row of assemblers.
| Wire          |  6        | Manufacture on demand, takes up more belt space than copper
| Green Circuits| 27        |
| Red Circuits  |  6        | Mostly bots, science.  Only major mall item is bulk inserters.  Sushi belt?
| Stone         |  4 .. 5   | Stone furnaces, rail, bricks/concrete.  Mostly off-site.
| Brick         |  4        | Steel furnace, oil refinery, concrete, walls.  
| Plastic       |  2        | Only used for red circuits, low density structures, and cannon shells.  Not suitable for primary mall belts.
| Batteries     |           | Only used for accumulators, flying robot frames, laser turrets, and personal logistics (batteries, roboports).  Secondary bus / p2p.
