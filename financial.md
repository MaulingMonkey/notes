# Overall Principles

*   Pay off high interest rate debts first
*   Compound interest is amazing
*   Diversified stocks for long term gains (short term unstable)
*   Bonds for short term stability (middling long term gains)
*   Diversify!  Don't put all your $$$ in one place.
    *   Don't put all your $$$ in tech          (tech bubbles have wrecked people)
    *   Don't put all your $$$ in crypto        (tech bubbles have wrecked people)
    *   Don't put all your $$$ in your house    (housing bubbles have wrecked people)
    *   Don't put all your $$$ in real estate   (housing bubbles have wrecked people)
    *   Don't put all your $$$ in anything      (bubbles have wrecked people)
    *   Since I work in tech, I consider investing *less* in tech (even though I know it better!)
        so a tech bubble is less likely to cost me my job *and* savings *at the same time*.
*   Diversify!  Consider having at least two accounts in entirely separate financial institutions.
    *   Bernie Madoff should only be able to run off with half your savings
    *   Your bank having a freakout and locking your account might only lock up half your savings
    *   Won't prevent the feds from freezing both accounts though.
*   Use your employer's 401k matching for great profit
*   Avoid early 401k withdrawls and associated penalties
*   Have an emergency savings fund.
